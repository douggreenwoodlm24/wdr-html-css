# wdr-html-css
An HTML and CSS assignment I did for a job application.

To install:
- Clone repository
- In the folder, run: npm install
- To preview in your localhost: npm start (this should start the page in http://localhost: 1234
- To build files for uploading to server: npm run build (this will place the files in /dist directory)
